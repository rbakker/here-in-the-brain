  "body": "### Technical specification of the micro-standard prototype\r\n\r\nThe prototype files are in the [prototype](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rbakker/where-in-the-brain/master/prototype/) folder of the repository, and are intended as background material to the an INCF seed funding application.\r\n\r\nThe file [userDocument.xml](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/userDocument.xml) represents a neuroscience data file, that follows the data standard specified in [someNeuroscienceDataFormat.xsd](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/someNeuroscienceDataFormat.xsd). To keep this example simple, 'someNeuroscienceDataFormat.xsd' defines only one element 'Measurement', with an attribute 'atlas:region' that represents the location of the measurement. That attribute 'atlas:region' is using the micro-standard that we propose. In 'someNeuroscienceDataFormat.xsd', the micro-standard is imported from a file [genericAtlas.xsd](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/genericAtlas.xsd). This file defines the region attribute, but does not place any restrictions on its content, because 'someNeuroscienceDataFormat.xsd' does not want to prescribe what atlas the user is supposed to use. In 'userDocument.xml', the user overrides the 'genericAtlas.xsd' with [myFavoriteAtlas.xsd](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/myFavoriteAtlas.xsd), which restricts the allowed values for the 'region' attribute to 'area A' and 'area B'.\r\n\r\nThe file 'userDocument.xml' can be submitted to standard XML validation tools or to an online validation service. For example on [Freeformatter.com](http://www.freeformatter.com/xml-validator-xsd.html) you can paste XML-content and get a validation report. You can examine the difference between the valid [userDocument.xml](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/userDocument.xml) or try [this document](https://rbakker.github.io/where-in-the-brain/prototype/invalidUserDocument.xml) that uses the undefined 'area C' as a region.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the seed-funding period, 'myFavoriteAtlas.xsd' can be replaced by one of the 25 atlases that we will provide as an initial seed to the atlasing micro-standard eco-system, and we hope that other atlasing resources will follow by creating their own schema documents.\r\n\r\nThis prototype only uses the 'myFavoriteAtlas.xsd' schema, which is (in principle) derived from the more extensive 'myFavoriteAtlas.xml' atlas specification document. That document is not implemented for this prototype, but it is going to be needed for more advanced operations beyond XML validation. For example, one could build an automatic pipeline that registers data from Atlas A to Atlas B. That pipeline would use the atlas specification documents to get a list of available imaging modalities for both atlases, and use them to compute an affine or nonlinear transformation between the two.\r\n",
